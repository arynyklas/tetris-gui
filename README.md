# Tetris
This is a regular tetris written in Python v3.7+ using Qt (PyQt5)

### The following functionality is implemented in the game:
- Ability to control the falling tile
- Score counter
- When one row of tiles is assembled, this row is removed and a point is added to the player
- The player loses if one of the tiles reaches the top edge
- On the main page, the player can see the status of the game, his record and last score, as well as pause the game or restart it altogether
- Soundtrack
- Save results after closing the game
- Implement sharing of your record result (copies to the clipboard)

### TODO:
- Normal icons for buttons
- Fix borders in game's frame

##### The basis of the game is taken from [here](https://zetcode.com/gui/pyqt5/tetris/)
